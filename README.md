This is an attempt to format SAM output of magicblast.

Start by comparing an mRNA (or a set of mRNAs) with a chromosome, all in FASTA format

$ magicblast -query QUERY.fa -subject SUBJECT.fa

Then, paste SAM output in the textarea and click "Read Str" to start exploring the alignments. Alternatively, you can press "Load example" to see how it works!
